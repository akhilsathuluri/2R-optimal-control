This folder has data pertaining to controls (Energy optimal control) which were a result of parametric study of the 2R manipulator.

dat_c(1, 2, 3) : These consists of the results of the length parameterisation in the order of cases reported in the report.

mxy_dat: Represent the data of parameterization of mass where x is the mass of the first link and y is the mass of the second link

To see the line plots (the time history plots) load the data in matlab and change the corresponding lengths in robolinplot.m file and run it. The corresponding movie can be seen with n times playback using the function movie(F,n). Note that all the movies are generated and stored in F variable.
